# Log Analysis Project

This project provides a Python script to analyze server log files for extracting valuable insights. The script supports functionalities such as identifying request counts per IP address, detecting suspicious activities, and finding the most accessed endpoints.

## Features

1. **Requests Per IP Address**:
   - Counts and displays the number of requests made by each IP address.
   - Results are sorted in descending order.

2. **Most Frequently Accessed Endpoint**:
   - Extracts and displays the endpoint accessed the most times.

3. **Suspicious Activity Detection**:
   - Flags IP addresses with excessive failed login attempts.

4. **CSV Output**:
   - Results are saved to a structured CSV file for further analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Samarth5TK/Log-Analysis.git
